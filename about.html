        <h2>Our Story: Following a passion</h2>
        <p id='about-text'>
          John Bentz has always had a passion for baking. After spending several years in all kinds of industries and feeling that there was more, he decided it was time to follow that passion. John began his
          professional baking career for a 5 Star ski resort in Park City, Utah as a pastry chef making all kinds of
          delicious sweets for skiers coming off the slopes. In the summertime (down season for skiing), he
          would bake delicious breads and muffins for a bakery in New Mexico. After several years of perfecting
          his skills in other people's bakeries, John decided it was time to start his own. With that goal in mind,
          John moved back to his hometown in South Dakota and started baking delicious breads, pastries, and
          other yummy goods out of his house. As word got out of John's delicious baked goods he knew he
          had made the right decision. That was the very beginning of 21 Baker Street.
